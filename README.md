### What we build

TMOS13 is a modular runtime engine for AI-powered conversational experiences. Instead of coding LLM behavior, you define it in declarative protocol files — plain text instructions that the engine assembles, routes, and manages at runtime.

One engine. Any vertical. Your brand.

### How it works

**You write protocols** — plain text files that describe how the AI should behave. An intake flow. A support agent. An onboarding experience. Whatever your product needs.

**You configure a manifest** — a single JSON file that defines commands, routing patterns, features, and theme. Swap the manifest, change the product.

**The engine handles everything else** — state management, deterministic routing, prompt assembly, session persistence, cross-session memory, token optimization, and multi-channel delivery.

### Built for every vertical

Legal intake · Financial advisory · Patient onboarding · Enterprise support · Sales enablement · Education · Customer service — same engine, different protocol.

### By the numbers

`35` engine modules · `738` tests passing · `80%` token reduction · `40%` of inputs routed without an API call
