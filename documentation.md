## About TMOS13

TMOS13 is a modular runtime for AI-powered conversational experiences. Instead of coding LLM behavior, you define it in declarative protocol files — plain text instructions that the engine assembles, routes, and manages at runtime.

One engine. Any vertical. Your brand.

**Built for:** Legal intake · Financial advisory · Patient onboarding · Enterprise support · Sales enablement · Education · Customer service
